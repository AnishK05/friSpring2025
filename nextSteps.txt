-- Notes Log --

I was able to set-up the virtual environment and I added the .gitignore. Everything should be set-up for that.

I talked to Dr. A and he said that setting up Diffusion Policy from scratch is pointless, because our TA Arnav already made a wrapper around it for standard gripper. So basically I just wasted my time today lol.

We can either use Arnav's wrapper or we can use Robomimic, which according to Dr. A works out of the box and is way easier to hook-up with Sawyer and such.

So, we can either take a few steps:

    1. Since we already have the environment set-up for Diffusion Policy, we can continue with that and just adopt Arnav's wrapper instead of dealing with setting up on our own.
    2. Just switch to Robomimic.
    3. Test both?

Let's discuss, let me know what works best
